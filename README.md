## Marika's Software Engineering Portfolio - @FAC29A

### Purpose

The purpose of this portfolio is to exhibit the learning outcomes achieved during my time at Founders and Coders (and beyond!). The portfolio includes code snippets and screenshots of projects I worked on, serving as a testament to my knowledge and skills during assessments.

This portfolio template is designed to showcase my skills and accomplishments to potential employers and others. Regularly updating my portfolio with new projects and learning outcomes allows me to demonstrate my ongoing growth and development as a programmer.
